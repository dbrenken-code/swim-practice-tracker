This is the Implementation Guide

**Initial Version V0.0**
- Requested input and output as detailed by client (Savannah King)
- See Developer notes at bottom

Inputting practices 
    Capable of having rounds of sets (ability to select a section of the practice and times by n rounds)
    Duplicate sets (if you have rounds with slight differences, it would be good to have the ability to duplicate a set and make slight adjustments)
    Ability to input the approximate effort level (percentage) for each part of the set
    8x50 at 85% @50 - 3x100 at 100% @2:30 etc.


Coding practices
    Work to Rest Ratios  - based on the approximate speed of male or female swimmer (eg. If we have an average female time of 30 seconds for a 100% 50m back, if we have max effort 50m on 1:00, it would be a 1:1 work to rest ratio)
    This means we need to have approximate times for the group of athletes for each stroke 50 
    We should divide these into male and female times because they will be different
    We would need to be able to input these numbers in order to find the W:R ratios  
    You’ll also need to relate the % of effort for the set with the max speed of that stroke.  – This will be complicated because if 30s is the max speed, what is 50% ? (We won’t have a number for 0%). We may have to input a 50% level time – We wouldn’t use less than 50%.
    The work to rest intervals will correspond to an intensity zone (see below)


Desired Output:
    Output weekly mileage  
    Output a graph with the percentage of the practice spent in each zone, and the mileage swum in each zone.
    Output weekly and monthly numbers for the same ^



========================================
Intensity Zones
Zone	Work to Rest 
1 – Aerobic Capacity	3:1 +
2 – Aerobic - Power	1:3 – 3:1
3 – Glycolytic - Capacity	1:4 – 1:8
4 – Glycolytic - Power	1:12-1:8
5 – ATP-CP Capacity	1:16-1:12
6 – ATP-CP Power	1:20-1:16
========================================




Developer Notes:

So far implementation requests require:
- An easy to use GUI for inputting practices
- A data-parsing/processing section
- A database to store data 
    - Database to *start out* local and on a per-workout basis, seperated by men/women
- A graphical output for the processed data

Future Implementation:
- Practice parsing software (I AM CONVINCED THIS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WHERE EVEN SWIMMERS CAN'T AGREE ON WHAT THE WORKOUT MEANS)
- Per swimmer database, maybe set up a server on a microcontroller (RasPi, Beaglebone black wifi)
- Analyze how well practices are working for swimmers by scrubbing swimrankings for PBs and meet results (over 1 year this should give a decent indication of the swimmer's training reauirements)
